## Status

**RP2350 port:** the firmware source has been ported for the Waveshare RP2350-Touch-AMOLED-1.75. Hardware validation and a verified UF2 are still pending. Implemented in the port: the 151 + shinies animated from microSD, full
life cycle (egg by rarity → evolution → farewell/release/runaway, each gated
behind a decision dialog), bred-Pokédex with gallery, battle stats (genes +
training), retention hooks (streak / bond / medals / name), biome + real-time
backgrounds, ball minigame, training bag, animated bath, RTC with offline
progression, battery (AXP2101) and PWR button, anti-burn-in dimming,
**sound (ES8311)**, **7 UI languages (English default)**, **starter choice on
first run**, and a one-click **web installer**.

Pending: wild encounters / battle (designed, not implemented), 3D case, soak
test. See **Roadmap**.

## Game manual (the actual numbers)

A quick reference to how the game really works (values straight from the code).

### Time & leveling
- **1 real minute = 1 in-game minute.** Your Pokémon gains **+1 level every hour**
  of real time. Leveling is purely time-based — caring well doesn't speed it up,
  but neglect *delays evolution*.
- It keeps **aging while powered off** (the RTC runs), catching up to **2 weeks** max.

### The four stats (0–100)
Needs: **FOOD**, **JOY**, **ENE** (energy), **HYG** (hygiene). Start 80 / 80 / 80 / 100.
While **awake**, per minute:

| Stat | Drain/min | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| FOOD | −2 | |
| ENE | −1 | −1 extra if overweight (weight > 50 → sluggish) |
| HYG | −1 | **−4 more per poop** on screen (max 3 poops) |
| JOY | −1 | **−2 extra** if FOOD < 30, **−2 extra** if HYG < 30 |

- ~**15 %/min** chance to poop (only if FOOD > 40). Poops tank hygiene fast.
- **Care slip-up** = letting any stat hit **≤ 10** (30-min cooldown so it counts once).
  Each slip-up **delays evolution by 1 level** and cools the bond.

### Actions
- 🍎 **Berry** (3 flavors): +25 FOOD. Each species has a **hidden favorite flavor**
  → +35 FOOD, +10 JOY, ♥, bond, and it gets revealed.
- 🍬 **Candy:** +10 FOOD, +12 JOY, but **+12 weight** (fattening).
- ⚽ **Play / minigame:** +JOY, −ENE; the minigame trains **SPEED** and burns weight.
- 🥊 **Training bag:** trains **STRENGTH** (~4 hits = 1 pt, cap +18/session), tires it.
- 🫧 **Bath:** clears poops, HYG → 100.
- 👆 **Pet it:** +5 JOY + bond.
- 🌙 **Sleep:** rest — ENE **+6/min**, needs drain ~**4× slower** with floors
  (FOOD 30 / JOY 35 / HYG 45). No poops, no slip-ups, can't run away while asleep.

### Eggs & who you get (spawn odds)
- **First ever pet:** you pick a starter — **Bulbasaur / Charmander / Squirtle**.
- Hatch the egg: tap it **3×** (or wait — it hatches on its own).
- Every later egg rolls a **rarity tier** (over the ~79 base forms that come from eggs):

| Tier | Base chance | After a proper goodbye | # species |
|---|---|---|---|
| ✨ Legendary | ~3 %\* | ~10 % | 5 |
| 🔵 Rare | ~27 % | ~45 % | 27 |
| ⚪ Common | the rest | the rest | 47 |

  \* Legendaries only start appearing once you've **registered ≥ 25** Pokémon.
- A daily **streak** and high **bond** push rare/legendary odds higher.
- A clean **goodbye blesses** the next egg; a **run-away curses** it (forces Common).
- Within a tier it favors species whose **evolution line you haven't finished** (so
  all 151 are completable).
- **Shiny:** base **1 / 48** (→ **1 / 24** right after a goodbye), improved by
  streak/bond down to a best of **1 / 8**. Tracked separately in the dex.
- Every hatch rolls unique **genes** (90–110 % per stat) — no two are identical.

### Evolution
- Triggers when **level ≥ its evolution level** (16 for most base forms; ~30 for
  stone-style, ~40 for trade-style) **and every stat ≥ 40** at that moment.
- **Never automatic** — a button appears and **you tap to witness it** (with a
  flicker between the old and new form). Each **slip-up delays it by 1 level**.
- You can **decline** ("keep form"); it re-offers at the next level.
- *Eevee* branches toward whichever evolution you're still missing.

### The three endings (you choose & witness each — none auto-fire)
- 💛 **Farewell** — when it's a **final form** that has lived **3 days**. A button
  appears; triggering it **blesses your next egg**. You can **postpone** ("stay
  together", re-offered in a day). The good ending.
- 💔 **Run-away** — if you let **all four stats sit at 0 for a full hour**. A single
  act of care cancels it. It **curses the next egg** (forces Common). The sad ending.
- 👋 **Release** — long-press the creature to let it go on your terms (neutral).

After any ending, a **new egg** appears.

### Bonds, streaks, medals, Pokédex
- **Streak** (player-wide, survives across pets): first care each real day; milestones
  at **3 / 7 / 30 / 100** days; skipping a day breaks it.
- **Bond** (per pet, resets on hatch): grows with affection (**cap +8/day**), cools on
  neglect. Both streak & bond improve egg/shiny odds.
- **8 medals** (Lv10/25/50, favorite berry found, 7-day streak, max bond, final form,
  "fit" = weight 0 & no slip-ups), per-pet + a global counter.
- **Pokédex:** raising a species registers it; **151 + shinies** to complete.

### Battle stats
ATK / DEF / SPD = real **Gen-1 base** × genes + level + training (STRENGTH ← bag,
SPEED ← minigame, DEFENSE ← 12 h of unbroken good care). *(Battles: on the roadmap.)*

## Hardware

- Board: [Waveshare RP2350-Touch-AMOLED-1.75](https://docs.waveshare.com/RP2350-Touch-AMOLED-1.75)
- RP2350A, 466×466 AMOLED, CO5300 display controller, CST9217 capacitive touch
- AXP2101 power management, PCF85063 RTC, QMI8658 IMU, ES8311 audio codec, microSD
- 520 KB on-chip SRAM and 16 MB flash; the framebuffer is about 434 KB, so the port keeps sprite RAM usage deliberately bounded
- Pin definitions are taken from the [official Waveshare documentation](https://docs.waveshare.com/RP2350-Touch-AMOLED-1.75) and kept in `pin_config.h`

## Build stack

The RP2350 port is built with **Arduino-Pico + arduino-cli**; **Arduino IDE is not required**.

| Component | Use |
|---|---|
| [Arduino-Pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) | RP2350 core, USB/PIO support |
| [Adafruit GFX Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) | Graphics API used by the TamaPoke adapter |
| Waveshare QSPI/PIO driver | CO5300 AMOLED |
| CST9217 / AXP2101 / PCF85063 / ES8311 ports | Touch, power, RTC and audio |


## Build / install

The active port lives on the **[`rp2350-port` branch](https://github.com/zafede1/RP2350-1.75/tree/rp2350-port)**.

Build with Arduino-Pico from the command line:

```bash
arduino-cli core install rp2040:rp2040@6.1.0
arduino-cli lib install "Adafruit GFX Library"
arduino-cli compile --fqbn rp2040:rp2040:rpipico2 .
```

The repository CI workflow is [here](https://github.com/zafede1/RP2350-1.75/actions/workflows/ci.yml). When a verified RP2350 UF2 is available, the browser installer uses **[pico⚡flash](https://picoflash.org/)** with the board in BOOTSEL mode.

### Web installer

**[Open the RP2350 web installer](https://zafede1.github.io/RP2350-1.75/web/)**. It does **not** use the old ESP Web Tools / Improv Wi-Fi Serial flow. Firmware flashing is handled through pico⚡flash, while the same page can push the sprite bundle to the board over Web Serial.

### Generate and load the sprites yourself

All sprites come from **[PMD SpriteCollab](https://github.com/PMDCollab/SpriteCollab)**
(CC BY-NC). You can regenerate the whole set and load it onto your board with the
pipeline below — the firmware accepts files over USB (PUT protocol with per-block
ACK), so you don't have to remove the card (it formats the SD to FAT if needed).

```bash
python3 tools/pack_pmd.py       # fetch + pack PMD sprites: the 151 + shiny -> tools/sdcard/mons/p[s]NNN.bin
python3 tools/make_thumbs.py    # Pokédex thumbnails (from the PMD sprites) -> thumbs.bin
python3 tools/send_sd.py        # send tools/sdcard/mons/* to the board's SD over USB
```

To make the **one-click web-installer bundle** instead of sending over USB:

```bash
python3 tools/pack_bundle.py    # bundle tools/sdcard/mons/* into web/sprites.pak
```

Then load it from the web installer's **"Load sprites"** button (or `send_sd.py`
above). `pack_pmd.py` also takes individual dex numbers, e.g. `pack_pmd.py 7 25`.
(~40 MB total, all PMD. Versioned under `tools/sdcard/`.)

## How to play

On first run you **choose a starter** (Bulbasaur / Charmander / Squirtle). After
that you start with an **egg**. Tap it 3 times or wait and it hatches. From then
on, care for your companion:

**Four stats** that decay: **FOOD**, **JOY**, **ENE** (energy), **HYG** (hygiene).
If one bottoms out it counts as a *slip-up*.

**Buttons (bottom arc, icons):**
- 🍎 **Feed** → food menu: 3 berries (each species has a hidden favourite that
  gives a bonus) and a candy (+happiness but it fattens; weight makes it sluggish).
- ⚽ **Play** → the pokeball minigame (trains SPEED).
- 🌙 **Light** → sleep/wake (recovers energy, dims the screen). While asleep,
  needs decay much slower (rest).
- 🫧 **Bath** → a foam scene that cleans up the poops.

**Touch gestures:**
- Tap the creature = pet it (+happiness, bond).
- Horizontal swipe = open the **Pokédex / gallery**.
- Vertical swipe up = open the **stat card** (4 pages: Profile / Battle / Medals /
  Progress; swipe between them; tap the name on Profile to rename; on Battle the
  "Train strength" button opens the bag).
- Swipe down = **set the clock** and pick the **language** + sound on/off.
- Long press (3 s) on the creature = **release** dialog.

**Physical PWR button:** short = screen on/off · long (4 s) = full power-off
(the RTC stays alive, so time passes even while it's off).

## Decisions: you choose, and you watch

The three life-cycle endings and evolution **don't happen on their own** — when
the conditions are met a button appears and you tap it (so you're present to
witness it), each opening a two-option dialog:

- **Evolution** (red button): *Evolve* (epic animation: halo, rays, sparkles and
  a **flicker between the old and new form**) or *Keep form* (re-offered next level).
- **Farewell** (gold button, final form + 3 days): *Say goodbye* (warm farewell,
  rising hearts → new egg) or *Stay together* (keep your companion; re-offered in
  a day). Tension: a maxed-out friend vs. completing the Pokédex.
- **Runaway** (dark button, total neglect for 1 h): a somber "feels abandoned"
  ending in the rain — caring for the creature cancels it.

## Sprites: PMD SpriteCollab everywhere

- **PMD SpriteCollab** (everything — main screen, stat card, minigame **and the
  Pokédex grid + detail view**): behaviour sprites — `tools/pack_pmd.py` packs
  actions (Idle, Walk L/R, Sleep, Eat, Hurt, Attack, Pose, Nod, DeepBreath) into
  the multi-action **TPK2** format (`/mons/pNNN.bin`). The engine in `TamaPoke.ino`
  makes the creature wander, gesture, curl up to sleep, chew and wince. Anchored by
  the feet (lowest content row), not the canvas. The Pokédex thumbnails
  (`thumbs.bin`, TPTH) are derived from these by `tools/make_thumbs.py`.
- **In-house workshop** (`tools/sprites.py`): 9 primitive-drawn sprites as a
  no-SD fallback + the UI icons. Generates `species.h`. Preview in
  `tools/sheet.png`, emit with `python3 tools/sprites.py emit`.

`sdmon.h/.cpp` loads the PMD sprites into PSRAM (`PmdMon` for TPK2) plus the
thumbnails (`SdThumbs`). `SdMon` (TPK1) remains as a dormant legacy fallback only.

## Pokédex and species data

`tools/dex_data.py` is the **single source**: name, slug, type (accent colour +
background biome), evolution line with gen-1 levels, rarities and starters.
`tools/dex_stats.py` has the real base stats (from PokéAPI). `tools/gen_names.py`
pulls the **official localized names** from PokéAPI into `tools/dex_names.py`
(only French and German differ in gen 1; Spanish, Italian and Portuguese use the
English ones). `gen_dex.py` emits `dex.h` (the `DEX_TBL[152]` table plus the
per-language name tables and the `dexName()` accessor). The pet's identity is its
Pokédex number (persisted in NVS).

- **Evolution** gen-1 style (levels 16/36/…; stones ≈30, trade ≈40; Eevee
  branches to whichever evolution you're missing). Each slip-up delays it 1
  level; it won't evolve with any stat < 40 or while asleep.

## Battle stats and training

Each creature has ATK/DEF/SPD = real gen-1 base × **genes** (90–110 %, rolled at
hatch) + level + **training**:
- SPEED ← the minigame
- DEFENSE ← sustained good care (12 h with no slip-ups)
- STRENGTH ← the training bag (whacking)

Shown on the Battle page of the stat card. The (hidden) weight goes up with candy
and burns off with training.

## Retention: streak, bond, medals, name

- **Streak** (the player's, persists across creatures): the first care of each
  real day advances the streak; 3/7/30/100 milestones are celebrated; skipping a
  day breaks it. Flame badge on the main screen.
- **Bond** (the creature's): rises slowly with care and petting, drops with slip-ups.
- **Medals** for the individual (level, berry, streak, bond, final form, fit) +
  a global counter. Medals page of the stat card.
- **Name**: touch keyboard; the nickname rules the header and the card.

High streak and bond **improve the egg roll** (rarity and shiny): caring well
always pays off.

## Life cycle, eggs by rarity, languages

The life cycle lasts **3 days** of play. Three endings (all leave a new egg):
**farewell** (final form + 3 days), **release** (long press), **runaway** (all 4
bars at zero for 1 h). Each bred species is recorded in the **bred Pokédex**
(normal and shiny separately).

The egg rolls rarity over the ~79 base forms (47 common / 27 rare / 5 legendary),
**biased towards the lines you're missing** (all 151 are completable), blessed by
a farewell and punished by a runaway. Legendaries only with 25+ registered.
**Shiny** 1/48 (better with streak/bond/farewell).

**Languages:** the UI ships in 7 languages — English (default), Spanish, French,
German, Italian, Portuguese and Japanese — switchable from the settings screen
(swipe down).
**Pokémon names are localized too**: French, German and Japanese show the
official names (Bulbizarre, Bisasam, フシギダネ...). Spanish, Italian and
Portuguese use the English ones, which is what those regions officially use for
gen 1.

## Backgrounds: biome + real time

The idle screen paints the sky from the **RTC's real time** (dawn / day / dusk /
night with moon and stars) and the ground from the **type's biome** (meadow,
beach, forest, volcano, mountain, snow). Sleeping forces night.

## Layout

- `TamaPoke.ino` — init, game loop, render of every screen, gestures, serial console, audio
- `pet.h` / `pet.cpp` — pet state and logic (stats, evolution, life cycle, streak/bond/medals, NVS)
- `sdmon.h` / `sdmon.cpp` — TPK1 (animated) and TPK2 (PMD) sprites + thumbnails, and file reception over USB (PUT/LS)
- `rtcbat.h` / `rtcbat.cpp` — PCF85063 RTC + AXP2101 PMU (battery, brightness, PWR button)
- `audio.h` / `audio.cpp` — ES8311 + I2S + Game-Boy-style tone synth (non-blocking task)
- `i18n.h` / `i18n.cpp` — the 7-language string tables
- `dex.h` — GENERATED (`gen_dex.py`): the 151 table
- `species.h` — GENERATED (`sprites.py`): fallback sprites, UI icons, colours
- `pin_config.h` — the board's official pins
- `tools/` — pipeline: `dex_data.py` (data), `dex_stats.py`, `dex_names.py` +
  `gen_names.py` (localized names), `gen_dex.py`,
  `sprites.py` (workshop), `pack_pmd.py` / `make_thumbs.py`
  (packers), `pack_bundle.py` (web bundle), `send_sd.py` (SD upload), `touch_log.py`
- `tools/sdcard/mons/` — the generated .bin files (animated, shiny, PMD, thumbnails)
- `web/` — the RP2350 browser installer (pico⚡flash link + Web Serial sprite loader)

## Serial console (115200, debug)

`STATS` (full state) · `SPEC <dex>` (change species) · `LVL <n>` · `HATCH` ·
`SHINY` · `NICK <x>` · `BYE` / `RUN` (farewell / runaway) · `ABANDON` (force the
runaway-ready state) · `WIPE` (factory reset → new game) · `BEEP` (audio test) ·
`REG` (Pokédex) · `EGGS` (simulate 20 eggs) · `GAL` (gallery) · `CAREDAY` ·
`TIME <epoch>` / `RTCSET <epoch>` · `HEALTH` (uptime + heap for the soak test) ·
`LS` / `PUT` (SD files).

To test fast: lower `PET_TICK_MS`, `MINUTES_PER_LEVEL` and `FAREWELL_AGE_MIN` in `pet.h`.

## Roadmap

- **Wild encounters / battle** — designed (see project memory): resolution by
  ATK/DEF/SPD with PMD Attack/Hurt animations, trainer rank as endgame. Style
  still to pick (auto / timing / turn-based).
- **Soak test** 24–48 h (instrumentation ready: `HEALTH` command/heartbeat).

*(Done: 3D-printed case [published on MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/es/models/2937822-tamapoke-a-pokemon-pokeball-tamagotchi); repo public with the browser installer + one-click sprite bundle.)*

## Community forks

- **[TamaPoke — Expanded](https://github.com/ShadowEnemyx/TamaPoke/tree/tamapoke-expanded-update)** by **ShadowEnemy** — a substantial community fork (different author/branch): a full **type-matchup battle system**, all **151 + shinies** with a **Pokédex / collection box** and daily goals, **6 UI languages**, **ES8311 sound**, starter choice and a one-click web installer. Worth a look. 🎮
- **[TamaPoke](https://github.com/DylanPDao/TamaPoke)** by **DylanPDao** — another substantial fork: **gym battles** and **LAN battles** between two devices, **movesets**, a **party + box** system, an **EV/IV** stat system, and coverage extended **up to Gen 3 (386)**. Keeps the PMD sprite pipeline. 🏆
