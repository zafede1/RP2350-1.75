# TamaPoke web installer

A one-click page that flashes the firmware and loads the sprites from the browser
(Chrome/Edge), with no Arduino or drivers. It uses
[ESP Web Tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/) to flash and **Web
Serial** to push the sprites to the SD with the firmware's `PUT` protocol (the
same one as `tools/send_sd.py`).

## Contents

- `index.html` — the page (flashing + sprite loader).
- `manifest.json` — ESP Web Tools config (points at the firmware).
- `firmware/tamapoke.bin` — combined firmware, flashable at `0x0`.
- `sprites.pak` — all the sprites in one bundle (TPAK), so the page sends them in
  one click. **Generated** by `tools/pack_bundle.py` (gitignored by default — see
  *Hosting the sprites* below).

## Regenerate

After changing the firmware or the sprites:

```bash
bash tools/build_web.sh        # recompiles -> firmware/tamapoke.bin AND rebuilds sprites.pak
```

## Test locally

Web Serial and ESP Web Tools need a **secure context**: `https://` or
`http://localhost`. To test:

```bash
cd web && python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000 in Chrome/Edge
```

## End-user flow

1. **Install TamaPoke** → flashes the firmware (pick the USB port; tick "Erase
   device" for a fresh board).
2. **Connect board** + **Load sprites** → downloads `sprites.pak` and copies it to
   the microSD over USB (progress bar, ~8–10 min). Close the step-1 install tab
   first: only one program can use the port at a time.
3. Restart (PWR button) → choose your starter and play.

A hidden "pick them manually" option lets advanced users send their own `.bin`.

## Hosting the sprites

`sprites.pak` is ~58 MB and **gitignored** so it doesn't bloat the repo. To make
the one-click sprite loader work on a real deployment, pick one:

- **Commit it** — add `web/sprites.pak` to git and serve it from Pages. Simple,
  but doubles the repo's sprite size.
- **Release asset** — attach `sprites.pak` to a GitHub Release and change the
  `fetch('sprites.pak')` URL in `index.html` to the release URL (keeps the repo
  small; watch out for CORS on the asset host).

All sprites are from PMD SpriteCollab, CC BY-NC (non-commercial sharing with
attribution is allowed); see [`../CREDITS.md`](../CREDITS.md).

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)

1. Repo settings → Pages → serve from `main`, folder `/web` (or move `web/` to
   `docs/`). Pages gives HTTPS automatically.
2. URL ends up at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

> **Pages on private repos** needs GitHub Pro/Team. If you make the repo
> **public** to use Pages for free, decide about the sprites first (see above and
> CREDITS).

## Limitations

- Desktop **Chrome/Edge** only (Web Serial isn't in Firefox/Safari).

## Local use on Windows

Do not open index.html directly with file://. Chrome gives local files an opaque origin, which can block local resource loading and browser APIs.

From this directory run:

```bat
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8000/
```

Or double-click run-local.bat.
